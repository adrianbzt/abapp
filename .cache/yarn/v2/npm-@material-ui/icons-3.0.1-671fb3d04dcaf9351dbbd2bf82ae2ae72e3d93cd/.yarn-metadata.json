    "readme": "# @material-ui/icons\n\nThis package provides the Google [Material icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/) packaged as a set of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package in your project directory with:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @material-ui/icons\n```\n\nThese components use the Material-UI [SvgIcon](https://material-ui.com/api/svg-icon/) component to\nrender the SVG path for each icon, and so a have a peer-dependency on the `next` release of Material-UI.\n\nIf you are not already using Material-UI in your project, you can add it with:\n\n```sh\n// with npm\nnpm install @material-ui/core\n\n// with yarn\nyarn add @material-ui/core\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use [material.io/tools/icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline) to find a specific icon.\nWhen importing an icon, keep in mind that the names of the icons are `PascalCase`, for instance:\n- [`delete`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete&style=baseline) is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/Delete`\n- [`delete forever`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete_forever&style=baseline) is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/DeleteForever`\n\nFor *\"themed\"* icons, append the theme name to the icon name. For instance with the\n- The Outlined [`delete`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete&style=outline) icon is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/DeleteOutlined`\n- The Rounded [`delete`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete&style=rounded) icon is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/DeleteRounded`\n- The Two Tone [`delete`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete&style=twotone) icon is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/DeleteTwoTone`\n- The Sharp [`delete`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=delete&style=sharp) icon is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/DeleteSharp`\n\nThere are three exceptions to this rule:\n- [`3d_rotation`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=3d_rotation&style=baseline) is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/ThreeDRotation`\n- [`4k`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=4k&style=baseline) is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/FourK`\n- [`360`](https://material.io/tools/icons/?icon=360&style=baseline) is exposed as `@material-ui/icons/ThreeSixty`\n\n## Imports\n\n- If your environment doesn't support tree-shaking, the **recommended** way to import the icons is the following:\n```jsx\nimport AccessAlarmIcon from '@material-ui/icons/AccessAlarm';\nimport ThreeDRotation from '@material-ui/icons/ThreeDRotation';\n```\n\n- If your environment support tree-shaking you can also import the icons this way:\n```jsx\nimport { AccessAlarm, ThreeDRotation } from '@material-ui/icons';\n```\n\nNote: Importing named exports in this way will result in the code for *every icon* being included in your project, so is not recommended unless you configure [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/). It may also impact Hot Module Reload performance.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nIf you are upgrading an existing project from Material-UI 0.x.x, you will need to revise the import paths\nfrom `material-ui/svg-icons/<category>/<icon-name>` to `@material-ui/icons/<IconName>`.\n\n[Here](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/packages/material-ui-codemod#svg-icon-imports)'s a `jscodeshift` [codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod) to help you upgrade.\n",
