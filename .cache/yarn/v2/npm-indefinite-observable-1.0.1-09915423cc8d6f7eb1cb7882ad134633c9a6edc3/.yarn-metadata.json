We wanted the simplest-possible Observable implementation, with no operators, no fancy scheduling.  The entire thing is basically [three statements in `subscribe`](https://github.com/material-motion/indefinite-observable-js/blob/develop/src/IndefiniteObservable.ts#L68-L72).\n\nIndefinite Observable is a subset of the [TC39 Observable proposal](https://tc39.github.io/proposal-observable/) that never `complete`s or `error`s.  It implements the [minimal-necessary functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it), but it should be completely interchangeable with the TC39 proposal for the subset that it does implement.\n\nIf you want a complete Observables library that works out-of-the-box, check out [xstream](https://github.com/staltz/xstream/), [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS/), [Most](https://github.com/cujojs/most/), [Bacon](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/), or [Kefir](https://github.com/rpominov/kefir/).  If you want to build your own Observables library that includes just the functionality you need, try [Indefinite Observable](https://github.com/material-motion/indefinite-observable-js/#indefinite-observable).\n\n## Usage ##\n\n```javascript\nimport IndefiniteObservable from 'indefinite-observable';\n\nconst moveEvent$ = new IndefiniteObservable(\n  (observer) => {\n    // Whenever you want the observable to dispatch a value, call\n    // observer.next(value).\n    element.addEventListener('pointermove', observer.next);\n\n    // Return a function that will perform any necessary clean up when the\n    // observable is unsubscribed from.\n    return () => {\n      element.removeEventListener('pointermove', observer.next);\n    }\n  }\n);\n\n// To receive the values dispatched by an observable, pass an observer to its\n// subscribe method.  An observer is just an object with a next method.\n//\n// subscribe returns a unsubscribe function.  Call that when you no longer want\n// to receive dispatches from the observable.\nconst unsubscribe = moveEvent$.subscribe({\n  next(moveEvent) {\n    console.log('got a pointer event: ', moveEvent);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nLearn more about [How Indefinite Observables work](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/documentation/L4/IndefiniteObservable).\n\n## Installation ##\n\n```\nyarn add indefinite-observable\n```\n\nor include as a script tag:\n\n```\n<script src = \"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/indefinite-observable/1.0.1/indefinite-observable.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nThis library aims to be as simple as possible, so modifications will be rare.  Reasons we might make changes are limited to:\n\n- bugs, or\n- remaining compatible with the subset of the Observable spec that we support.\n\nIf you'd like to add operators, static methods, or other features, we invite you to depend upon us subclassing `IndefiniteObservable` in your own module.  In fact, [that's how we add features too](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-js/blob/develop/packages/streams/src/MotionObservable.ts).\n\nOf course, we welcome improvements to the examples and documentation in this repo.\n\n### Bundling ###\n\nOur source is available in 3 flavors: a TypeScript module, a JavaScript module, and a JavaScript bundle.  Any changes made to the first need to be reflected in the other two.  This should be handled for you automatically via a pre-commit hook.  If you have a clean working copy after committing, you're good.  If not, amend the commit with the new build before pushing.\n\nIf you need to bundle it independently, run\n\n```\nyarn run build\n```\n\n### Testing ###\n\n```\nyarn run test\n```\n\n## License ##\n\n[Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n",
